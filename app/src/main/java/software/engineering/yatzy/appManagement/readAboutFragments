To synchronize with AppManager, and hence the Server, each GUI Fragment should:

1. Implement Updatable interface
This provides the ability to receive asynchronous updates from cloud. By examining the arguments
passed in the update() method, each Fragment may decide whether it is affected by the update and
should load in some new data from global variables. See interface Updatable for further description.

2. Report itself as the currently displayed fragment to AppManager
AppManager.getInstance().currentFragment = this;
This way the AppManager can update (only) the relevant Fragment by calling: currentFragment.update(arguments)
